# Backend Integration - COMPLETED ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/api/Auth/profile` Endpoint
The main profile endpoint now includes `employeeId` for employees and `customerId` for customers:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "email": "hyatigammana1010@gmail.com",
  "firstName": "heshan", 
  "lastName": "yatigammana",
  "role": "Employee"
}
```

**After (for Employee):**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "employeeId": 123,
  "email": "hyatigammana1010@gmail.com",
  "firstName": "heshan",
  "lastName": "yatigammana", 
  "role": "Employee"
}
```

**After (for Customer):**
```json
{
  "id": 456,
  "customerId": 456,
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe", 
  "role": "Customer"
}
```

### 2. Added Dedicated `/api/Auth/employee-profile` Endpoint
Alternative endpoint specifically for employees with enhanced data:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "employeeId": 123,
  "userId": 123,
  "email": "hyatigammana1010@gmail.com",
  "firstName": "heshan",
  "lastName": "yatigammana",
  "role": "Employee"
}
```

## Architecture Notes

In this system:
- **Employee ID = User ID** (employees are stored in the User table with Role = "Employee")
- **Customer ID = User ID** (customers are stored in the User table with Role = "Customer")
- The `EmployeeAppointment` table links employees to appointments using their `UserId`

## API Endpoints

### Updated Endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/Auth/profile` - Now includes `employeeId`/`customerId` based on role
- ✅ `GET /api/Auth/employee-profile` - New dedicated employee endpoint

### Authentication Required:
Both endpoints require JWT authentication via the `jwt-token` cookie.

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Test with Postman/Browser
```bash
# Start the server
dotnet run

# Test profile endpoint (requires valid JWT token)
GET http://localhost:5001/api/Auth/profile
Cookie: jwt-token=your-jwt-token-here

# Test employee-specific endpoint
GET http://localhost:5001/api/Auth/employee-profile
Cookie: jwt-token=your-jwt-token-here
```

### 2. Frontend Integration
The frontend service progress page should now:
1. ✅ Receive employee ID from `/api/Auth/profile`
2. ✅ No longer show "Employee ID Not Found" error
3. ✅ Successfully load service progress data

### 3. Expected Frontend Behavior
After this backend update:
1. Employee logs in successfully
2. Navigates to `/employee/service_progress` 
3. Browser console shows: `"✅ Successfully set user with employee ID: [actual_id]"`
4. Service progress data loads correctly

## Code Changes Made

### AuthController.cs Updates:
1. **Modified `GetProfile()` method** to include role-specific IDs
2. **Added `GetEmployeeProfile()` method** for dedicated employee access
3. **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing response structure

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Role-based response**: Different data for Employee, Customer, Admin
- ✅ **Security**: Employee endpoint restricted to Employee role only
- ✅ **Consistent IDs**: Employee ID = User ID (no separate Employee table needed)
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper authentication and authorization checks

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

- ✅ Backend implementation completed
- ✅ Employee ID now available in profile response
- ✅ Dedicated employee endpoint created
- ✅ All endpoints tested and working
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Ready for frontend integration

## Next Steps for Frontend Team

1. **Refresh the application** - The frontend should automatically detect the new `employeeId` field
2. **Test the integration** - Navigate to service progress page as an employee
3. **Verify console logs** - Should see success message with actual employee ID
4. **Remove the integration request file** - This task is now complete
