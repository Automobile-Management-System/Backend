# Admin Dashboard Backend - Updated Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### âœ… **Removed RequestStatus Enum**
- Removed the `RequestStatus` enum from `Models/Entities/Enums.cs`
- Updated the admin dashboard implementation to work without any custom status tracking

### âœ… **Updated System Alerts Logic**
The `GetSystemAlertsAsync()` method now generates alerts based on existing entity data without modifying any current entities:

1. **Modification Requests Alert**
   - Counts all `ModificationRequest` entries
   - Treats all existing modification requests as needing review

2. **Pending Appointments Alert**
   - Uses existing `AppointmentStatus.Pending` to find appointments awaiting approval
   - No entity changes required

3. **Employee Training Alert**
   - Mock alert based on employee count from existing `User` entities with `Employee` role
   - No entity modifications needed

4. **System Backup Alert**
   - Mock success alert to demonstrate different alert types

### âœ… **No Entity Changes Required**
The implementation now works entirely with your existing entities:
- âœ… `User` - unchanged
- âœ… `Appointment` - unchanged  
- âœ… `ModificationRequest` - unchanged
- âœ… `Payment` - unchanged
- âœ… All other entities - unchanged
